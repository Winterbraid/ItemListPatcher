# ItemListPatcher

A simple utility for editing the DDDA item list file using JSON snippets. Work in progress.

itemList.itl and any JSON text files should be placed in the same folder as the executable.

Run the executable as is to extract item data into human-readable JSON format.

Drag and drop a JSON file (must end in .txt or .json) onto the executable to patch the item list. The JSON file might contain all or some entries from the item list.

The DDDA item data format is not fully understood. This program is a prototype, is not thoroughly tested, and does not sanitize your input. Use at your own risk.
